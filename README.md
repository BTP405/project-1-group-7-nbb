## 8. Additional Sections (Optional)
    - FAQ: 
        Q: "How do I increase the screen size?"
            A: Go to config.ini and set the [Screen][scale] value. Default is 5, but if it's too small, try 6 or 7. 
        Q: "How can I pause the game so my pet doesn't die overnight?"
            A: You can temporarily change the config.ini [Poop][interval] to 3600 for 1 hour a poop, and [Poop][max] to 10.
    - Troubleshooting: 
        Q: "I think I messed up when editing the config.ini file, the game crashes now"
            A: Run python config.py to reset the config.ini file to its default.
